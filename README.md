# TextChart

`@solothought/textchart` provides an easy way of generating charts from text. It is helpful for developers who doesn't want to spend time in learning charting tools.

Another benefit of text charting is version control. You focus on the actual contents and they're easy to track. This is very helpful in organizations where work increases gradually.

Your text chart size is small to share or store. and can be converted in a chart(graph) any time.

Currently, this library only supports generating flow chart. The supported format can be found at [#solothought/text2obj](https://github.com/NaturalIntelligence/text2obj) which is used a core dependency for parsing text to intermediate object that helps to draw charts.
