# Text2Chart Github Preview

This plugin detects when a file ending in .stflow is opened on GitHub. When such a file is detected, a 'Preview' button is added to the interface. Clicking this button will display a flowchart generated from the .stflow file’s contents, allowing you to visually interpret the file's flow.

The plugin is designed to remain stable and does not require updates unless GitHub’s page structure changes.

Note: graph contents are loaded from https://solothought.com. So please ensure, you have the access to the site.
