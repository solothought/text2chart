## 1. MJS (ES Module)
- **For Modern JavaScript Projects**: ES Modules (mjs) are widely supported in modern JavaScript environments, including many frontend frameworks and modern build tools (e.g., Webpack, Vite, Rollup).
- **Tree Shaking and Smaller Bundles**: ES modules support tree shaking by default, allowing bundlers to remove unused code from the package, which can result in smaller bundle sizes for users.
- **Better Browser Compatibility for ES Modules**: Browsers now support ES modules natively through <script type="module">, so users can load ES modules directly without needing a bundler.
- **Recommended for Frontend Frameworks**: Frameworks like Svelte, React, and Vue often prefer ES modules for optimized builds and compatibility with tree shaking.

## 2. CJS (CommonJS)

- **For Node.js Compatibility**: CommonJS (cjs) is the module format used by Node.js. If you want your library to be compatible with Node.js applications or older CommonJS-only environments, providing a cjs module format is useful.
- **Compatibility with Legacy Bundlers and Tools**: Many older bundling tools and environments that donâ€™t fully support ES modules may still expect CommonJS. This can make your package easier to use across a wider range of projects, especially server-side applications or legacy systems.

## 3. IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)

- **Direct Browser Use**: The IIFE format is suitable for direct use in browsers without a module loader or bundler. It wraps your code in a function that executes immediately and attaches it to the global scope, so users can directly reference your library as a global variable (e.g., window.FlowChartLib.FlowChart).
- **For Simple HTML Usage**: If someone wants to include your library in a simple HTML page without any bundling tool, the IIFE version is straightforward to use.
